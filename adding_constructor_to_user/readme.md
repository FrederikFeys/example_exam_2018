# Adding Constructor to a User class

Add a constructor to the class `User` so a user object can be created by supplying a firstname and lastname. The main should be fully functional. Check it out for how the constructor should function.

A working main should result in a possible output as shown below:

```text
Please enter your firstname: Nico
Please enter your lastname: De Witte
Welcome Nico De Witte
```
