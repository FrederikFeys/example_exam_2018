# Average and Sum

Implement the methods `average()` and `sum()` so they make the average and sum of the numbers in `NumberList`.

To retrieve a number from the `ArrayList` as an `int` you will need to cast the return value of the `get()` method to an `int` as shown below:

```java
int number = (int)(numbers.get(i));         // i is the index
```
